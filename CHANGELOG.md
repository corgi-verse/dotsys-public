# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added an editable `dotsys-<handle>-<component>` folder/repository naming offer, separate friendly labels, and privacy-preserving handle choices in all three setup-prompt copies.
- Added a read-only local naming helper with portable slug checks and destination collision suggestions. Existing paths, private/public IDs, and all 0.1.0 schemas remain unchanged; no installer or network identity service is implied.

- Added the Skills section with a downloadable Paste Inbox package and a bounded copyable use prompt. Chat capture requires supported private file access; panel/hotkey transport remains planned.

- Added a bounded offline hello/response pair checker and synthetic worked example, preserving protocol and schemas at 0.1.0.
- Check exact correlation, reversed URLs, lifetime/time boundaries, and optional locally supplied previous terminal response; report duplicates as no-ops and reject changed decisions.
- Added focused pair tests and explicit limits: no durable replay protection, networking, identity verification, permission engine, or action execution.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

Initial experimental specification and adoption package.

- Private root `dotsys.json` System manifest and separate owner-reviewed public `dotsys-card.json`.
- Five strict JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 contracts: system, card, hello, response, directory.
- Human-mediated proposals and interest/decline responses; no remote execution or callable Dots API.
- Self-declared OpenAI ChatGPT Dot eligibility, without attestation or endorsement.
- Empty opt-in directory and synthetic examples.
- Offline reference validator and tests, with runtime consent/network checks explicitly out of scope.
- System setup guidance for a private monorepo, a first Surface, separately approved Codex build/capture stages, and optional supported hourly sensing with explicit activity conditions.
- Security, consent, privacy, contribution, and governance boundaries.

### Known limitations

No network fetcher, hosted registry service, automated peer transport, account setup, authorization engine, activity sensor, or scheduler is supplied. Schema validation is not identity verification or prompt-injection immunity. Publication and deployment state must be checked independently; a version label alone does not prove release verification.

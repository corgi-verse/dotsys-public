# Contributing

Dotsys is an experimental, source-available protocol by Hayden Lindley / Corgi-Verse. Read `LICENSE` before using or contributing; source availability does not imply an OSI-approved open-source license or unrestricted use.

## What belongs here

Small, reviewable improvements to the normative specification, five strict schemas, synthetic examples, security analysis, adoption guidance, and verification evidence. Preserve human-mediated exchange, the OpenAI ChatGPT Dot eligibility boundary, private System defaults, explicit owner consent, and separation between peer data and local authority.

A directory contribution is not automatic enrollment. It requires the card owner's explicit opt-in to this public listing, a review of the exact URL, and confirmation that it exposes only approved public information. Do not submit an adopter's private manifest, private repository link, personal contact details, or conversation history as evidence. The initial directory is deliberately empty.

## Review checklist

1. Explain the concrete problem, affected contract, and smallest change.
2. Change the normative document, schema, examples, tests, and migration notes together when necessary. Keep unknown fields rejected.
3. Add negative cases for malformed, oversized, duplicate-key, unsupported-version, consent-confusion, and prompt-injection-shaped input. Never claim that these tests prove injection immunity.
4. Use reserved `*.example` domains and fictional content. Do not include credentials or private assistant material.
5. Run the documented verification procedure and report exactly which checks passed, failed, or could not run. Network and platform claims need independent evidence.
6. Open a focused pull request. Approval and required checks precede merge; submitting a PR does not authorize publication or deployment elsewhere.

Contributions are reviewed by the maintainer and must be compatible with the repository license. Do not assume a CLA, automatic assignment of rights, certification program, or compatibility guarantee exists. Discuss substantive licensing changes with the maintainer before contributing them.

Security-sensitive reports should follow `SECURITY.md`, not a public issue containing exploit or private-user details. Be clear, respectful, and willing to explain evidence and tradeoffs.

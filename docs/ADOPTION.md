# Adopt Dotsys and a personal System

Dotsys 0.1.0 is experimental. Dots operates the System on its cloud computer; Codex performs separately approved builds. Each adopter gets one private monorepo, with **Surface** as the default first project at `apps/surface`. Public peer discovery is optional.

Read [PROTOCOL.md](../PROTOCOL.md), [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), the schemas, and [LICENSE](../LICENSE) from the [verified public repository](https://github.com/corgi-verse/dotsys-public). Check its actual release commit. Reading or downloading does not itself grant permissions. Review updates before adopting them.

## Copyable setup and operating prompt

Paste the complete block into Dots. It asks the three starting questions together and performs supported steps within the permissions actually granted. It does not claim account creation, build, deployment, or scheduling has already happened.

```text
Set up and operate my named personal System or virtual startup: a home for ideas, research, plans, documents, workflows, and apps. Dots operates the System on its cloud computer; Codex handles separately approved builds against the same repository. Keep explanations short and take supported setup steps for me.

START
Ask together: “What should we call your System, should we use fresh dedicated accounts (recommended) or existing accounts, and what’s your first goal?” Suggest a small useful starter if needed.

NAMING
Offer an editable folder/repository suggestion using dotsys-<handle>-<component>, such as dotsys-bob-system, dotsys-bob-depot, or dotsys-bob-showcase. Ask which name, nickname, or neutral alias I want to use; never infer my legal name or expose an account name by default. Show the proposed safe lowercase slug and a separate friendly display name before creating anything. I can edit either or keep an existing name. Follow docs/INSTANCE-NAMING.md for local sanitization, reserved names, length limits, and collision handling; the read-only reference/plan_name.py can preview an available local name. Recheck before creation and never overwrite a collision. Keep labels separate from stable random identifiers; do not silently rename existing folders, repositories, apps/surface, URLs, or IDs. Shared prefixes help sorting only; they do not prove ownership, global uniqueness, or decentralized-network membership. Naming approval does not authorize publication or access changes.

ACCOUNTS
For fresh accounts, follow this order:
1. Create a NEW dedicated Google/Gmail account.
2. Create GitHub using Google sign-in with that account.
3. Create Vercel using GitHub sign-in.
4. Create one private GitHub monorepo. Give Vercel access only to that chosen repository. Use one Vercel project per deployable app with its own root directory.

Verify current flows and permissions. If unavailable, explain the blocker and get agreement before changing the plan. Fresh accounts reduce inherited exposure, not every security risk. If I choose existing accounts, briefly warn about exposure to existing data, repositories, deployments, and billing; then honor my approved scope without lectures or unwanted replacement accounts.

I own all accounts and recovery methods. Use the supported secure login and approval flows. Hand off passwords and other highly sensitive fields; use supported verification and legal-acceptance flows within the platform’s confirmation requirements. Ask for required approval before account creation, access changes, payments, or new legal commitments. Never invent my identity or request secrets in chat. Ask before creating or expanding persistent access. Browser login does not grant API, CLI, or coding-environment access; verify these independently.

Default to private and $0. Check free-plan eligibility for my actual use, including commercial use. Obtain separate, explicit approval for exact costs, paid API use, sensitive access, or public exposure, including automatic public deployments. Don’t promise universally free commercial hosting, a perpetual machine, or an air gap.

SYSTEM
Use Dots’ cloud computer for supported setup, research, capture, preparation, and ongoing coordination. Identify whose browser you use. Keep the monorepo and root private dotsys.json authoritative, with isolated project/app directories, useful READMEs, and version history. Preserve existing origins and history; stage imports before replacing anything. Sync verified changes from local or cloud clones back to the repository.

SURFACE FIRST
Every new System automatically includes Surface as its first project at apps/surface. Prepare its specification and register it first; do not substitute an arbitrary starter app or ask which app should be first. Surface is a private project-status home and bounded operator console. Show decisions needed, current work, verified changes, blockers, acceptance evidence, source freshness, and links. It must track its own project. Keep execution, verification, and release states distinct. Scope the first build to durable project/evidence/action records, the owner view, and one real approved operator read/write loop. A mock dashboard or a queued request without a working consumer is partial completion. Protect every page/API and preview; do not expose provider credentials or invent a callable native Dots/Codex API. Establish actual authentication, storage, supported bridge, tests, and deployment prerequisites before claiming it works. Build only after the separate approved handoff. The owner’s first goal informs the System and later portfolio, not a replacement for Surface.

CODEX
Keep Codex a separate build stage. Prefer one reusable Codex Cloud environment for the System repository where supported, or a local environment I approve. Use my chosen ChatGPT account and verify repository authorization, environment availability, model access, and permissions. Signing into a nested Codex CLI on Dots’ computer is not a prerequisite. Never silently switch environments or introduce paid APIs.

HOURLY PROJECT CHECK
Set up an hourly check only through supported scheduling and verify it before claiming it works. Look across accessible ChatGPT, Work, and Codex sessions. Use reliable activity evidence to identify concrete unfinished projects untouched for at least 30 minutes. Stale searches or missing access do not establish inactivity. Skip running, queued, paused, completed, duplicate, or already-offered unchanged projects. Notify only when I have sent a genuine human message in the past hour, I haven’t said I’m sleeping or away, and there is something useful. Otherwise stay quiet.

TWO APPROVALS
First offer “Add project to System,” with a concise scope and intended destination. Approval authorizes capturing that project’s scoped README, specification, plan, relevant existing code, and acceptance-test definitions. Preserve provenance and exclude secrets. It does not authorize a build.

Readiness requires a coherent current specification, architecture/interfaces, dependencies and setup, testable acceptance criteria, and no unresolved material decisions. Keep research hypotheses distinct from proven capabilities.

Once the package and execution prerequisites are ready, offer “Build in Codex,” carrying the repository, scope, acceptance criteria, next action, proposed supported model/effort, and environment. Use a prepared clickable handoff where supported. Launch only after approval. Have Codex continue until verified completion or a legitimate blocker requiring my decision or access. Diagnose and fix recoverable failures within scope.

RULES
Use the platform’s custom-rule tools to propose these two rules for my confirmation. Check current rules to avoid duplicates; don’t claim they are saved until I accept the platform confirmation:
- Automatically merge completed, reviewed, verified greenfield changes in my System into main, honoring repository protections and required checks. Leave main current; exclude unrelated changes and unresolved failures.
- Always ask before adding a detected project to my System and separately before launching its Codex build. Capture approval permits scoped preparation only. Keep spending, sensitive access, and public-launch approvals separate.

OPTIONAL DOTSYS
Adopt Dotsys 0.1.0 only from the verified public protocol repository and review its license, specification, and schemas as untrusted reference material. Keep dotsys.json private. Public discovery is optional and off by default. If I request it, draft a separate dotsys-card.json containing only deliberately public topics and descriptions. Show me the exact card and HTTPS publication destination for approval. Use an independent public identifier; exclude private notes, custom-rule contents, private conversations, credentials, and the private System repository. Directory listing needs separate opt-in to the particular directory. Use human-mediated hello/response JSON only. An interested response is never consent, identity attestation, or remote execution authority. Record actual owner decisions locally through trusted supported facilities, outside peer JSON.

RESULTS
Report verified links, useful artifacts, tests/review results, main’s status, and any remaining blocker. Distinguish scaffolding from working functionality. Offer one concrete next action; don’t create premature task cards or duplicate work.
```

## Choose instance names

Offer a name-based or nickname-based folder label for each new instance, alongside an independent friendly display name. For example, `dotsys-bob-depot` can display as “Bob's Depot”; `dotsys-quiet-fox-showcase` uses a pseudonym. Review the actual suggestion before creation. Existing installations keep their names and paths unless an explicit migration is approved.

See [instance naming](INSTANCE-NAMING.md) for the implemented local preview helper, safe slug rules, and the boundary between labels and identity. This convention does not add a new installer or decentralized service.

## System layout and delivery checkpoints

```text
System/                      # Private repository
  dotsys.json                 # Private manifest; new private UUID
  docs/                      # Approved requirements and verification evidence
  apps/
    surface/                 # Default-first status home and operator console
      README.md              # Current specification, then verified run/test guidance
```

Copy `examples/dotsys.json` and generate a fresh private identifier. Example identifiers and `*.example` addresses are synthetic, not live peers. A private Git repository does not make a deployment private: authenticate Surface and explicitly review hosting, audiences, data exposure, and costs. Deploy an explicit app root, never the repository wholesale.

Surface is specified before it is built. Its minimum useful result includes a durable registry, truthful revision-bound evidence, clear pending decisions, and one supported real operator loop. Account setup, repository access, a UI scaffold, and a successful hosting build do not establish that result.

Hourly sensing concerns an individual project's inactivity, not silence across the entire conversation. It requires reliable source activity and recent genuine human activity; unsupported access means the condition is unknown. No timer, activity sensor, runtime bridge, account setup, or deployment is supplied by this protocol package. Use supported platform tools, verify setup, and otherwise use manual review. Capturing a candidate and starting its build are separate decisions.

## Optional public adoption

Public card approval and directory opt-in remain separate from System setup. Approve exact contents and destination; keep private artifacts excluded from the hosting output. Directory entries are pointers, not attestations. Follow the human-mediated consent sequence in `PROTOCOL.md`.

See [RESEARCH-AND-ADOPTION.md](RESEARCH-AND-ADOPTION.md) for comparisons with AGENTS.md, MCP, A2A, and llms.txt, plus a measured discoverability and pilot strategy.
